1 - Master's Thesis: Process Monitoring in Additive Manufacturing Through Machhine Learning:

Industry 4.0 denotes the trend toward utilizing data-centric, automated systems in production technologies facilitated by 
cutting-edge technologies like the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence. With the availability of data and strong 
hardware, machine learning can handle complex problems in production.
Additionally, additive manufacturing is being directly used in the construction of products. 
However, process inconsistencies that occur due to this production technologyâ€™s nature pose obstacles. 
Consequently, it is difficult to utilize additive manufacturing to construct highly stressed, strength-critical parts.
To address this problem, a technology for process monitoring is being developed on the basis of powder bed fusion of metals 
using laser beam technology, whereby pores in additive-manufactured parts via acoustic signals during manufacturing processes 
are detected. This study aims to detect pores in the field of additive manufacturing by processing acoustic signals using machine-learning methods.

The figure above illustrates the signal data acquisition process employed in this study. As depicted, a laser source directs beams onto an additively manufactured part. 
When the laser beams interact with the part, acoustic signals are generated within it. 
These signals are captured by a sensor positioned beneath the build plate. Since additive manufacturing constructs parts 
layer by layer, these acoustic signals serve as indicators to identify the presence of pores in the individual layers that make up the part.
